## Overview
This directory will contain the frontend code for the `Calculator Application` built using `React`. This frontend provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend calculator API.

## Features
- **Basic arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Advanced operations**: square root, logarithm 
- Clear function to reset the calculator
- Toggle the negative sign (+/-) of input number
- Formatting for large numbers using exponential notation to avoid spilling outside the display 

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: To test if it is installed, open the Command Line `Terminal`, and run:
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
  - If not installed, the latest version of Node.js can be downloaded from:
   - Windows: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer
   - macOS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer
   - Linux: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager (Recommendation: Use `Brew`)

### Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `Project/frontend/` directory, and open a command line terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Running the Application
To run the application with the development server, execute the following command in the `frontend` project directory:
